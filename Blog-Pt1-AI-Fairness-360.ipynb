    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various sectors, from healthcare to finance, by providing powerful tools to analyze data and make informed decisions. However, as these AI systems become more integrated into society, ensuring that they operate fairly and without bias becomes increasingly important. Bias in AI can lead to unfair outcomes, which can have significant social and ethical implications.\n",

    "IBM’s AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) toolkit helps developers detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models. In this series, we will explore AIF360, its importance, and how to start using it to create more equitable AI systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.\tData Bias: When the training data is not representative of the real-world population.\n",
    "2.\tAlgorithmic Bias: When algorithms inadvertently amplify existing biases in the data.\n",
    "3.\tSocietal Bias: Reflecting broader societal prejudices and inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biased AI systems can lead to discriminatory practices in areas such as hiring, lending, law enforcement, and healthcare. For example, a biased healthcare algorithm might disproportionately favor certain demographic groups, leading to disparities in care. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world examples of biased AI systems highlight the urgency of addressing this issue. For instance, a study found that a widely used healthcare algorithm disproportionately favored white patients over black patients when determining eligibility for certain health programs, leading to disparities in care.\n",

    "AIF360 includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Datasets**: A variety of datasets commonly used in fairness research, such as the Adult Income dataset and the COMPAS dataset.\n",
    "- **Metrics**: A collection of fairness metrics to evaluate bias in datasets and models, including disparate impact, statistical parity, and equal opportunity difference.\n",
    "- **Algorithms**: Several bias mitigation algorithms, such as reweighing, prejudice remover, and adversarial debiasing.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Definition**: Attributes that refer to characteristics of individuals that are legally protected against discrimination. These can include race, gender, age, religion, disability status, and other similar attributes.\n",
    "**Example**: In a dataset about job applicants, 'race' and 'gender' could be considered protected attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Privileged Groups\n",
    "**Definition**: Subsets of individuals within a dataset that have historically been favored or have had advantages in societal contexts based on certain protected attributes.\n",
    "**Example**: In the context of gender, males may be considered a privileged group in certain employment datasets.\n",
