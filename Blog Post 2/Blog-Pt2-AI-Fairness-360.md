### Introduction

Welcome back to our blog series on AI Fairness 360! In Part 1, we explored the foundational concepts of bias in AI and demonstrated how to create dataset objects and evaluate fairness metrics using IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit. Understanding and detecting bias in machine learning models is crucial, but the next step is equally important: mitigating this bias to ensure fair and equitable AI systems.

In this second installment, we will delve into various bias mitigation techniques provided by AI Fairness 360. These techniques are designed to address bias at different stages of the machine learning pipeline, from pre-processing the data to post-processing the model's predictions. By implementing these techniques, we can reduce bias and improve the fairness of our AI models, ultimately leading to more ethical and responsible AI applications.



### Learning Objectives

By the end of this blog post, you will be able to:
- Understand different bias mitigation techniques available in AI Fairness 360.

In this post, we will provide step-by-step guides and code snippets to help you implement and understand these bias mitigation techniques. Let's get started on the journey to making our AI models more fair and equitable!



# **Overview of Bias Mitigation Techniques**



Bias mitigation is an essential step in developing fair and ethical AI systems. AI Fairness 360 offers various techniques to reduce bias at different stages of the machine learning pipeline. These techniques can be broadly categorized into three types: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing.

#### **A) Pre-Processing Techniques**

Pre-processing techniques aim to modify the training data to reduce bias before the model is trained. By addressing bias in the dataset, these methods ensure that the model learns from a more balanced and fair representation of the data.

- **Reweighing**: This technique assigns different weights to the examples in the training data based on the protected attributes to ensure that the model gives equal importance to all groups.
- **Optimized Preprocessing**: This technique transforms the dataset to remove bias while preserving the relationships between features and the target variable.

#### **B) In-Processing Techniques**

In-processing techniques modify the learning algorithm itself to reduce bias during model training. These methods integrate fairness considerations directly into the training process.

- **Adversarial Debiasing**: This technique uses adversarial learning to minimize bias. It trains the model to make accurate predictions while an adversary tries to detect bias based on the protected attributes.
- **Prejudice Remover**: This technique adds a regularization term to the learning algorithm's objective function to penalize biased outcomes, promoting fairness during training.

#### **C) Post-Processing Techniques**

Post-processing techniques adjust the predictions of a trained model to reduce bias. These methods are applied after the model has been trained and focus on modifying the modelâ€™s outputs to ensure fairness.

- **Equalized Odds Post-Processing**: This technique adjusts the model's predictions to achieve equalized odds, ensuring that the false positive and false negative rates are the same across different groups.
- **Calibrated Equalized Odds Post-Processing**: This technique combines calibration with equalized odds to adjust the model's predictions, maintaining both fairness and accuracy.

In the following sections, we will provide step-by-step guides to implement these techniques using AI Fairness 360. By understanding and applying these methods, you can develop AI models that are not only accurate but also fair and unbiased.



## **A) Implementing Pre-Processing Techniques**



Pre-processing techniques modify the training data to mitigate bias before the model is trained. These methods ensure that the model learns from a more balanced and fair dataset. In this section, we will focus on the Reweighing technique.

### **Step-by-Step Guide: Reweighing Technique**

The Reweighing technique assigns different weights to the examples in the training data based on the protected attributes to ensure that the model gives equal importance to all groups.



#### 1. Load the Dataset and Convert to AIF360 Dataset Object

First, we need to load the dataset and convert it into an AIF360 dataset object. We'll use the same Recidivism dataset from Part 1.



```python

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline, Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, ConfusionMatrixDisplay

# Import BinaryLabelDataset
from aif360.datasets import BinaryLabelDataset

# Enable pandas dataframe output
from sklearn import set_config
set_config(transform_output='pandas')


pd.set_option("display.max_columns", 100)

# Load the data 
df = pd.read_csv("data/Iowa_Prison_Recidivism_Status_20240724.csv", 
                 index_col=0, usecols=range(0, 23-7))   

## Quick Conversion of Dtypes for Clean Data
df = df.convert_dtypes(convert_string=False)

# Drop unnecessary columns
drop_cols = ['Supervising Unit','Supervision Start Date','Supervision End Date'] + [c for c in df.columns if 'Year' in c]
df = df.drop(columns=drop_cols)
df.info()

# Encode the 'race' column as binary white or non-white.
race_map = {'White': 0, 'Black': 1, 'Hispanic': 1, 'Asian or Pacific Islander': 1,
            'American Indian or Alaska Native': 1, 'Unknown': 1, 'Other':1}
df['Race'] = df['Race'].map(race_map)

# Encode the "Sex" column
sex_map = {"Male": 0, "Female":1}
df['Sex'] = df['Sex'].map(sex_map)


df.head()
```

```python

## Create the Preprocessor
# Categorical Pipeline
cat_cols = df.select_dtypes(include='object').columns
cat_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')
ohe = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False)
cat_pipe = make_pipeline(cat_imputer, ohe)


# Numeric Pipeline
num_cols = df.select_dtypes(include='number').columns
num_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
num_pipe = make_pipeline(num_imputer)



# Convert Boolean Columns to Integers
bool_cols = df.select_dtypes(include='bool').columns
df[bool_cols] = df[bool_cols].astype(int)



# Create the column Transformer
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('cat', cat_pipe, cat_cols),
                                               ('num', num_pipe, num_cols)],
                                 remainder='passthrough',
                                 verbose_feature_names_out=False)

```



### Choice: Dataset First or Train-Test-Split First

We will perform our train-test-split before applying the preprocessig steps in order to avoid data leakage between the train and test sets.  However, you may see examples and tutorials that use the BinaryLabelDataset built-in `.split()` method for creating training and test datasets. We will avoid doing so to have the most appropriate machine learning workflow possible. 

#### Train-Test Split


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Conventional train-test split
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Preprocess the training set
train_df = preprocessor.fit_transform(train_df)

# Preprocess the test set
test_df = preprocessor.transform(test_df)  # Example preprocessing step

train_df.head()
```

We will use the traditional train-test-split method to split the dataset into training and testing sets. Many of the official AIF360 examples use pre-constructed datasets and do not acknowledge the data leakage issue.

### Assessing Model Bias 

Before we implement mitgation methods dataset, let' create a baseline model without bias mitigation and examine its fairness metrics.

We will use the following function to evaluate our machine learning models and to collect and compare their performance at the end of this post. 


```python

def evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred, output_dict=False, results_label=''):
    """
    Evaluate the performance of a classification model by calculating classification metrics and displaying a confusion matrix.

    Parameters:
    - y_true (array-like): The true labels.
    - y_pred (array-like): The predicted labels.
    - output_dict (bool, optional): Whether to return the classification report as a dictionary. Default is False.
    - results_label (str, optional): A label to identify the results. Default is an empty string.

    Returns:
    - If output_dict is True, a dictionary containing the classification report and the results label.
    """
    print(f"Classification Metrics: {results_label}\n\n")

    print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred))
    ax = ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_true, y_pred,
                                            normalize='true',cmap='Greens',
                                            display_labels=['Non-Recid','Recid'])
    ax = plt.gca()
    ax.set_title(f"Confusion Matrix: {results_label}")
    plt.show()
    
    if output_dict==True:
        report = classification_report(y_true, y_pred, output_dict=True)
        report['Label'] = results_label
        return report

```

##### Baseline Model (No mitigation applied)

We will be using a LogisticRegression model throughout this blog post for simplicity. However, this approach can be applied with any machine learning classification model.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Extract features and labels from the reweighed dataset
X_train = train.features
y_train = train.labels.ravel()

X_test = test.features
y_test = test.labels.ravel()

# Train the model
model =  LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', class_weight='balanced', random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
eval_unmit = evaluate_model(y_test, model.predict(X_test), results_label='Unmitigated Model', output_dict=True) 
```

    Classification Metrics: Unmitigated Model

We can see that we have an overall accuracy of 61%, however, when examining the recall scores we can see that the model is more confident in predicting reincarceration(recid) than Non-Recidivism.

### Fairness Metrics - Model Predictions

Evaluating the fairness of a machine learning model is crucial to ensure that the model does not exhibit bias towards any particular group. AI Fairness 360 provides the `ClassificationMetric` class, which offers a variety of fairness metrics to assess the performance of your models. In this section, we'll define key fairness metrics and demonstrate how to calculate them using AI Fairness 360.



In order to use it, we must have a dataset of true values and a dataset of predicted values. Therefore, we will make a copy of the test dataset before overwriting the `.labels` 


```python
type(test)
```




    aif360.datasets.binary_label_dataset.BinaryLabelDataset




```python
from aif360.metrics import ClassificationMetric
from aif360.explainers import MetricTextExplainer

# Get predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Create a new dataset with predictions
test_pred = test.copy()
test_pred.labels = y_pred


# Define privileged and unprivileged groups
privileged_groups = [{'Sex': 0}]  # Male
unprivileged_groups = [{'Sex': 1}]  # Female/Other


# Evaluate fairness
metric = ClassificationMetric(
    test,
    test_pred,
    unprivileged_groups=unprivileged_groups,
    privileged_groups=privileged_groups
)

explainer = MetricTextExplainer(metric)
```

#### **Key Fairness Metrics**

1. **Disparate Impact**: Measures the ratio of the favorable outcome rates between the unprivileged and privileged groups. 

   $$
   \text{Disparate Impact} = \frac{\text{P(y=1|unprivileged)}}{\text{P(y=1|privileged)}}
   $$


- A value close to 1 indicates fairness.
- A value less than 1 indicates bias toward predicting positive outcomes for the privileged class.
- A value greater than 1 indicates bias towards the unpriviledged class.



```python
# Disparate Impact
disparate_impact = metric.disparate_impact()
print(f"Disparate Impact: {disparate_impact:.2f}")

print(explainer.disparate_impact())
```

    Disparate Impact: 1.56
    Disparate impact (probability of favorable outcome for unprivileged instances / probability of favorable outcome for privileged instances): 1.5575745625603374


We can see that, with a value of 1.56, which is significantly than 1, indicating that our baseline model is biased towards predicting a favorable outcome for the unprivileged class.


2. **Statistical Parity Difference**: The difference in the probability of favorable outcomes between the unprivileged and privileged groups. 
   $$
   \text{Statistical Parity Difference} = \text{P(y=1|unprivileged)} - \text{P(y=1|privileged)}
   $$
   
- Value close to 0 indicates fairness.
- Negative Value indicates that the unprivileged group has a lower probability of receiving positive outcomes compared to the privileged group.
- Positive Value indicates the privileged group has a lower probability of receiving positive outcomes compare to the unprivileged group.


```python
# Statistical Parity Difference
statistical_parity_difference = metric.statistical_parity_difference()
print(f"Statistical Parity Difference: {statistical_parity_difference:.2f}")

print(explainer.statistical_parity_difference())
```

    Statistical Parity Difference: 0.25
    Statistical parity difference (probability of favorable outcome for unprivileged instances - probability of favorable outcome for privileged instances): 0.24767723324582192


We can see that unprivileged classes are 4% less likely to be predicted to receive a positive predictio than the privileged class.


3. **Equal Opportunity Difference**: The difference in the true positive rates between the unprivileged and privileged groups. 



$$
   \text{Equal Opportunity Difference} = \text{TPR(unprivileged)} - \text{TPR(privileged)}
$$

-	Value Close to 0: A value close to 0 suggests that the model has similar true positive rates for both groups, indicating fairness in terms of equal opportunity.

-	Positive Value: A positive Equal Opportunity Difference indicates that the unprivileged group has a higher true positive rate compared to the privileged group.
-	Negative Value: A negative Equal Opportunity Difference indicates that the unprivileged group has a lower true positive rate compared to the privileged group.


```python
# Equal Opportunity Difference
equal_opportunity_difference = metric.equal_opportunity_difference()
print(f"Equal Opportunity Difference: {equal_opportunity_difference:.2f}")

print(explainer.equal_opportunity_difference())
```

    Equal Opportunity Difference: 0.19
    True positive rate difference (true positive rate on unprivileged instances - true positive rate on privileged instances): 0.19284858787621217



4. **Average Odds Difference**: The average difference in false positive rates (FPR) and true positive rates (TPR) between the unprivileged and privileged groups. 


$$
   \text{Average Odds Difference} = \frac{1}{2}[(\text{FPR(unprivileged)} - \text{FPR(privileged)}) + (\text{TPR(unprivileged)} - \text{TPR(privileged)})]
$$

- Value Close to 0: A value close to 0 suggests that the modelâ€™s TPR and FPR are similar for both groups, indicating fairness in terms of both positive and negative outcomes.
- Positive Value: A positive Average Odds Difference indicates that the unprivileged group has higher FPR and/or higher TPR compared to the privileged group.
- Negative Value: A negative Average Odds Difference indicates that the unprivileged group has lower FPR and/or lower TPR compared to the privileged group.


```python
# Average Odds Difference
average_odds_difference = metric.average_odds_difference()
print(f"Average Odds Difference: {average_odds_difference:.2f}")

print(explainer.average_odds_difference())
```

    Average Odds Difference: 0.25
    Average odds difference (average of TPR difference and FPR difference, 0 = equality of odds): 0.25029379501431104



##### **Metric Interpretation - Rules of Thumb**

| Metric                        | Definition                                                                                       | Interpretation                                                                                       | Threshold for Significant Bias                        | Bias Directionality                                            |

| **Statistical Parity Difference** | Difference in probability of favorable outcomes between unprivileged and privileged groups.     | 0 indicates similar favorable outcomes for both groups.                                              | < -0.1 or > 0.1                                         | < 0: Against unprivileged<br> > 0: Against privileged            |
| **Equal Opportunity Difference** | Difference in true positive rates between unprivileged and privileged groups.                   | 0 suggests equal positive prediction rates for both groups.                                          | < -0.1 or > 0.1                                         | < 0: Against unprivileged<br> > 0: Against privileged            |
| **Average Odds Difference**   | Average difference in false positive and true positive rates between unprivileged and privileged groups. | 0 indicates similar error rates across both groups.                                                 | < -0.1 or > 0.1                                         | < 0: Against unprivileged<br> > 0: Against privileged            |

By calculating these fairness metrics, we can assess the performance and fairness of our baseline logistic regression model. In the next section, we will apply the Reweighing technique to mitigate bias in the dataset and re-evaluate these metrics to observe the improvements in fairness.

    - Disparate Impact: 1.56
    - Statistical Parity Difference: 0.25
    - Equal Opportunity Difference: 0.19
    - Average Odds Difference: 0.25


##### Interpreting Our Baseline Model's Fairness


According to our rules of thumb:
- A Disparate Impact of 1.56 suggests significance bias against the privileged class.
- A Statistical Parity Difference of 0.25 indicates significant bias against the privileged class.
- An Equal Opportunity Difference of 0.19 indicated a significant bias against against the privileged class.
- An average odds difference of 0.25 indicate a significant bias against the priviledged class. 




### 2. Apply the Reweighing Algorithm to Address Bias



Next, we apply the Reweighing algorithm to the dataset. This will create a new dataset with weights assigned to each example to ensure fair representation.

`CONFIRM:` We can only mitigate the bias for one protected attribute at a time.


In part 1, we found that the dataset was more biased in terms of Sex than Race, so we will use Sex for our examples in this blog post. 


```python
from aif360.algorithms.preprocessing import Reweighing

# Define privileged and unprivileged groups
privileged_groups = [{'Sex': 0}]  # White
unprivileged_groups = [{'Sex': 1}]  # Non-White

# Apply Reweighing
RW = Reweighing(unprivileged_groups=unprivileged_groups, privileged_groups=privileged_groups)
reweighed_train = RW.fit_transform(train)
reweighed_test = RW.transform(test)

```

We have now updated the values stored in the datasets under the `.instance_weights` methods based on the bias in the specified protected attribute.


```python
# Comparing original vs. reweighed training datasets
display(train.instance_weights[:5])
reweighed_train.instance_weights[:5]
```


    array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])





    array([1.01838057, 0.90648459, 1.01838057, 1.01838057, 0.97094552])



We can see that the weights have been adjusted to account for the bias in the training dataset.

#### 3. Train a Machine Learning Model

Using the reweighed dataset, we train a machine learning model. For simplicity, we'll use a logistic regression model. We will take advantage of the `sample_weight` argument in the `.fit()` method of the model to pass in the calculated weights.



##### Applying Reweighed Features


```python

# Extract features and labels from the reweighed dataset
X_train = reweighed_train.features
y_train = reweighed_train.labels.ravel()
# Extracting the reweighed sample weights
sample_weight = reweighed_train.instance_weights


X_test = reweighed_test.features
y_test = reweighed_test.labels.ravel()

# Train the model
label="Logistic Regression - Reweighed"

**4. Evaluate the Model Using Fairness Metrics**

Finally, we evaluate the model's performance and fairness using AIF360's metrics.



```python

fairness_reweigh = evaluate_fairness(reweighed_test, model.predict(X_test), unprivileged_groups, privileged_groups,
                  results_label=label, output_dict=True)
```

    Fairness Metrics: Logistic Regression - Reweighed
    - Disparate Impact: 0.88
    - Statistical Parity Difference: -0.06
    - Equal Opportunity Difference: -0.06
    - Average Odds Difference: -0.05


>Simplified Summary Table for Interpretation

| Metric                          | Interpretation                                                               | Threshold for Significant Bias |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Disparate Impact**            | 1 implies perfect fairness.                                                  | < 0.8 or > 1.25                |
| **Statistical Parity Difference** | 0 indicates similar favorable outcomes for both groups.                     | < -0.1 or > 0.1                |
| **Equal Opportunity Difference** | 0 suggests equal positive prediction rates for both groups.                 | < -0.1 or > 0.1                |
| **Average Odds Difference**     | 0 indicates similar error rates across both groups.                          | < -0.1 or > 0.1                |


After reweighing:
- Disparate impact is 0.88, which is above the 0.8 threshold, indicating that there is no significant bias.
- Statistical Parity Difference is -0.06, which is within the < -0.1 threshold, indicating no significant bias.
- Equal Opportunity Difference is -0.06, which is within the threshold, indicating no significant bias.
- Average Odds Difference is -0.05, whic is within the threshold, indicating no significant bias. 

Applying Reweighing was sufficient to eliminate the bias of our baseline model.


This example demonstrates how to apply the Reweighing technique to mitigate bias in your dataset before training a model. By ensuring fair representation in the training data, you can develop more equitable AI systems.

In the next section, we will explore in-processing techniques to mitigate bias during the training phase. Stay tuned!



## **B) Implementing In-Processing Techniques**



In-processing techniques modify the learning algorithm itself to reduce bias during model training. These methods integrate fairness considerations directly into the training process. In this section, we will focus on the Adversarial Debiasing algorithm.



### **Adversarial Debiasing**



Adversarial Debiasing uses adversarial learning to minimize bias. It trains the model to make accurate predictions while an adversary tries to detect bias based on the protected attributes. The goal is to improve the fairness of the model by making it difficult for the adversary to distinguish between different protected groups.




**3. Apply the Adversarial Debiasing Algorithm**

Next, we apply the Adversarial Debiasing algorithm to train the model.

>Note regarding Variable Scope Reuse: 
The tf.compat.v1.variable_scope is set with reuse=tf.compat.v1.AUTO_REUSE, allowing the reuse of variables within the same scope. This prevents the ValueError related to existing variables.




```python

from aif360.algorithms.inprocessing import AdversarialDebiasing
import tensorflow as tf


# Ensure compatibility with TensorFlow 2.x
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()

# Define the adversarial debiasing model
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
with tf.compat.v1.variable_scope('debiasing', reuse=tf.compat.v1.AUTO_REUSE):

    adversarial_debiasing = AdversarialDebiasing(
        privileged_groups=privileged_groups,
        unprivileged_groups=unprivileged_groups,
        scope_name='debiasing',
        debias=True,
        sess=sess,
    )

# Train the model
adversarial_debiasing.fit(train)

**4. Make Predictions and Create Predicted Dataset**

Make predictions on the test set using the trained Adversarial Debiasing model.



```python

# Make predictions on the test set
pred_dataset = adversarial_debiasing.predict(test)

# Convert predictions to labels
y_pred = pred_dataset.labels

label = "Adversarial Debiasing"
eval_adv_debias = evaluate_model(test.labels, pred_dataset.labels, results_label=label, output_dict=True)

**5. Evaluate the Model Using Fairness Metrics**

Finally, we evaluate the model's performance and fairness using AIF360's metrics.



```python
fairness_adv_debias =  evaluate_fairness(test, pred_dataset, unprivileged_groups, privileged_groups,
                                         convert_to_dataset=False, output_dict=True, results_label=label)
```

    Fairness Metrics: Adversarial Debiasing
    - Disparate Impact: 1.14
    - Statistical Parity Difference: 0.12
    - Equal Opportunity Difference: 0.08
    - Average Odds Difference: 0.13


We can see that in-progressing with the Adversarial Debiasing Algorithm was not sufficient to reduce the bias to non-significant values.

## C) Implementing Post-Processing Techniques



Post-processing techniques adjust the predictions of a trained model to reduce bias. These methods are applied after the model has been trained and focus on modifying the modelâ€™s outputs to ensure fairness. In this section, we will focus on the Equalized Odds Post-Processing algorithm.



### Equalized Odds Post-Processing



The Equalized Odds Post-Processing algorithm adjusts the modelâ€™s predictions to ensure that the false positive rate and true positive rate are equal across different groups. This technique ensures that the modelâ€™s performance is consistent for both the privileged and unprivileged groups.

Step-by-Step Guide: Equalized Odds Post-Processing

1. Train a Baseline Machine Learning Model

We have already trained a baseline logistic regression model and created the train and test datasets.




2. Make Predictions on the Test Set

Make predictions on the test set using the trained model.



```python
# Get predictions for test set and convert to dataset object

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

```


3. Convert Predictions to AIF360 BinaryLabelDataset

Convert the test set and predictions into AIF360 BinaryLabelDataset objects.


```python

# Create a new dataset with predictions
test_pred = test.copy()
test_pred.labels = y_pred.reshape(-1, 1)
```

4. Apply the Equalized Odds Post-Processing Algorithm

Apply the Equalized Odds Post-Processing algorithm to adjust the modelâ€™s predictions.


```python
from aif360.algorithms.postprocessing import EqOddsPostprocessing
# Apply Equalized Odds Post-Processing
eq_odds = EqOddsPostprocessing(
    privileged_groups=privileged_groups,
    unprivileged_groups=unprivileged_groups,
    seed=42
)

```


```python

# Fit the post-processing algorithm to the test data
eq_odds.fit(test, test_pred)


# Transform the predictions
# pred_transformed = eq_odds.transform(test_pred)
pred_transformed = eq_odds.predict(test_pred)
```


```python
# Evaluate model performance using the transformed predictions
label = "Logistic Regression - EqOdds"
eval_eqodds = evaluate_model(test.labels, pred_transformed.labels, results_label=label, output_dict=True)
```

    Classification Metrics: Logistic Regression - EqOdds


â€‹    
                  precision    recall  f1-score   support
    
             0.0       0.75      0.51      0.60      4738
             1.0       0.46      0.71      0.56      2836
    
        accuracy                           0.58      7574
       macro avg       0.60      0.61      0.58      7574
    weighted avg       0.64      0.58      0.59      7574




â€‹    
![png](output_87_1.png)
â€‹    


As we can see, the model performance has decreased after transforming the model predictions. Let's asses fairness now to see if we've reduced the bias from our original model. 


```python
fairness_eqodds = evaluate_fairness(test, pred_transformed, unprivileged_groups, privileged_groups, 
                                    convert_to_dataset=False, output_dict=True, results_label=label)
```

    Fairness Metrics: Logistic Regression - EqOdds
    - Disparate Impact: 1.04
    - Statistical Parity Difference: 0.02
    - Equal Opportunity Difference: 0.01
    - Average Odds Difference: -0.00


By applying the Equalized Odds Post-Processing algorithm, we were able to adjust the modelâ€™s predictions to ensure fairness across different groups. After applying this technique, we re-evaluated the modelâ€™s fairness using key metrics to determine the effectiveness of the post-processing adjustments and confirmed that the model's fairness metrics are all inidcating no significant bias.

### **5. Comparing Mitigation Techniques**

In this section, we will compare the effectiveness of the different bias mitigation techniques we have implemented: pre-processing (Reweighing), in-processing (Adversarial Debiasing), and post-processing (Equalized Odds Post-Processing). We will use fairness metrics to evaluate each technique's impact on the model and discuss the trade-offs between accuracy and fairness.



### **Comparative Analysis**




```python
# Combine the fairness metrics into a DataFrame
df_fairness = pd.DataFrame([fairness_unmit, fairness_reweigh, fairness_adv_debias, fairness_eqodds])
df_fairness = df_fairness.set_index('Label')

To ease interpretation, we will use Pandas Styling to annotate any metrics that have crossed the fairness thresholds.

1. **Reweighed Model**: This technique adjusts the dataset before training, which can lead to improved fairness but might slightly reduce the model's accuracy. It's a good balance for scenarios where data preprocessing is feasible. 
- Indeed, we saw a very slight decrease in accuracy from 0.61 to 0.60. However, our average recall, precision, and f1-score are unchanged.

2. **Adversarial Debiasing Model**: This technique incorporates fairness constraints directly into the training process, often achieving significant fairness improvements. However, it can be computationally intensive and might require more tuning.
- Without additional tuning Adversarial Debiasing is the most accurate model (0.65), but has terrible Recall for the 0 class (0.28),and the worse F1-score. 

3. **Equalized Odds Post-Processing Model**: This technique adjusts the model's predictions after training, which can be simpler to implement and often leads to noticeable fairness improvements. However, it might introduce a trade-off with accuracy depending on the degree of adjustment required. 
- EqOdds did indeed significantly decrease the accuracy by 3% (0.61 to 0.58), however it actually improved the model's recall for the 1.0 class. 


### **6. Conclusion**

In this series, we have explored the critical aspects of bias in machine learning models and the importance of fairness in AI systems. We started with understanding and detecting bias using AI Fairness 360, then moved on to implementing various bias mitigation techniques, including pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing methods. Here's a brief recap and the key takeaways from our journey:

#### **Recap of Bias Mitigation Techniques**

1. **Pre-Processing Techniques (Reweighing)**
   - Modify the training data to reduce bias before model training.
   - Ensures fair representation in the dataset, leading to more balanced model outcomes.

2. **In-Processing Techniques (Adversarial Debiasing)**
   - Incorporate fairness constraints directly into the training process.
   - Aim to make the model's predictions less distinguishable based on protected attributes.

3. **Post-Processing Techniques (Equalized Odds Post-Processing)**
   - Adjust the model's predictions after training to ensure fairness.
   - Focus on balancing false positive and true positive rates across different groups.

#### **Key Takeaways**

- **Understanding Bias**: Recognizing the different types of bias (data bias, algorithmic bias, and societal bias) is the first step towards building fair AI systems.
- **Detecting Bias**: Utilizing fairness metrics such as Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference, and Average Odds Difference to evaluate model fairness.
- **Mitigating Bias**: Implementing bias mitigation techniques at different stages of the machine learning pipeline to reduce unfairness and improve equity.
- **Comparing Techniques**: Assessing the effectiveness of each mitigation technique and understanding the trade-offs between accuracy and fairness.

#### **Importance of Continuous Monitoring**

Fairness in AI is not a one-time effort but a continuous process. It is crucial to regularly monitor and evaluate the fairness of AI models as new data and scenarios emerge. By doing so, we can ensure that AI systems remain equitable and do not inadvertently perpetuate biases.

#### **Future Directions**

As AI technology continues to evolve, so will the approaches to ensuring fairness. Future advancements may include more sophisticated bias detection and mitigation techniques, integration of fairness considerations into all stages of AI development, and broader adoption of fairness standards and regulations.

### **Call to Action**

- **Implement Bias Mitigation**: Apply the techniques discussed in this series to your own projects to develop fairer AI models.
- **Engage in Discussions**: Join the conversation on AI fairness by sharing your experiences, challenges, and solutions on social media or in professional forums.
- **Explore Further**: Continue learning about AI fairness through additional resources, research papers, and case studies.

By prioritizing fairness in AI, we can build systems that not only perform well but also promote equity and justice in society. Together, we can make a significant impact on the future of AI.

Thank you for following along with this series. Stay tuned for the next part, where we will delve into advanced topics or case studies to further illustrate the application of AI Fairness 360 in real-world scenarios.
